## Books:
Holes by Louis Sachar. Read it in grade 3. First book I felt there was something profound about. I've never seen the movie.

The Gods Themselves by Isaac Asimov. The best sci-fi novel I've read read so far.



## Movies:
Whiplash.

The Dark Knight.

Basically any Scorcese movie. The Irishman is a masterpiece. Haven't seen dialogue like it in a movie since.

## Shows:
Mr. Robot. The best show of all time. Created by Sam Esmail.

Sherlock.

Dexter. I was a fan of the ending when it felt like no one was.


## Games:
Paradise Killer. Criminally underrated. From the soundtrack to the aesthetic. Indie game as well.

Bioshock 1+2. Played 3. Wasn't as memorable but still solid.
