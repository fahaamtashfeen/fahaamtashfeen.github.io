## Books:
Holes by Louis Sachar. Read it in grade 3. First book I felt there was something profound about. I've never seen the movie.

The Gods Themselves by Isaac Asimov. The best sci-fi novel I've read so far.
Oh and Dune, and Dune Messiah. I've heard people say Dune Messiah serves as an epilogue to Dune. Regardless. The first Dune book is very special, and if you finish it, you'll probably be compelled to read the next one.


## Movies:
Whiplash.

The Dark Knight.

Basically any Scorcese movie. The Irishman is a masterpiece. Haven't seen dialogue like it in a movie since.

## Shows:
Mr. Robot. The greatest show of all time. Created by Sam Esmail.

Sherlock.

Dexter. I was a fan of the ending when it felt like no one was.


## Games:
Paradise Killer. Criminally underrated. From the soundtrack to the aesthetic. Indie game as well.

Bioshock 1+2. Played 3. Wasn't as memorable but still solid.
