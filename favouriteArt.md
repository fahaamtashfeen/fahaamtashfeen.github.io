## Movies:
Whiplash.

The Dark Knight.

Basically any Scorcese movie. The Irishman is a masterpiece. Haven't seen dialogue like it in a movie since.

## Shows:
Mr. Robot. The best show of all time. Created by Sam Esmail.

Sherlock.



## Games:
Paradise Killer. Criminally underrated. From the soundtrack to the aesthetic. Indie game as well.

Bioshock 1+2.
