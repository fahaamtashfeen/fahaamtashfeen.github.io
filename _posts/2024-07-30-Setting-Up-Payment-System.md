title: Setting Up Payment System for Zenith
author: Fahaam
category: Zenith

For the Zenith website, I currently have the Inflame Sample Tape as the main offering, along with a mastering chain for songs in FL Studio (I might make it available to more DAWs as well). The Sample Tape has a FL Studio Theme Skin that I created for it based on the pack. I decided to take pictures of both the skin in FL Studio as well as the mastering chain at work (I pulled up the project I had first used it on). I'm not sure exactly how I will display the pictures on the website and make them look good yet. Having the assets there is a great start though. The idea alone. Simple but probably effective. This was all done on July 20th on stream.

I also spent time setting up a payment system. For now I'm using stripe and was able to configure a basic payment experience but it's rudimentary currently. One side of me thinks I should have it completely configured to the website's theme/look (which after looking at stripe, looks possible). The other side thinks it should take the customer to it's own page (which is what it does currently) so that they are familiar with the payment experience. And therefore trust it more. This was also done on stream on the 20th (looks like we streamed a total of 9+ hours that day - lots of dead time though), and pretty interesting to set up and work through.

More on the way,
