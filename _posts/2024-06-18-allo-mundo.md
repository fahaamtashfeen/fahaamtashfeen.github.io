# Allo Mundo


Why not have more fun than the classic "Hello world!"?

I always try to change it up.

This blog took much, much longer than I anticipated to set up. However, I became **FAR** more familiar with git and github during the project by design.

I also, of course, became more acquainted with Jekyll and, by proxy, Ruby.

Anyways, now I can finally post updates on my portfolio, learning process, and ideas.

Cheers.
