title: Studying For Stats, Helping a Friend With Their Website

I decided to study for a statistics test I had coming up, on stream. The reasoning behind this was the same as the reasoning behind streaming in the first place. Documentation and showing my journey in this space, including these moments.

Halfway through the stream my friend Kash hopped in the chat and we started discussing the website she's been working on. She told me she'd been working on sculpting a 3D model and integrating that on to her website. Her progress was already impressive consider she doesn't have any real background in coding. She was discussing threejs which I still have no familiarity with at this time other than it's popularity for implementing 3d animations into websites.

We ended up spending some of the stream debugging an issue she was having with getting the 3D model to actually appear on her page. She quickly set up her GitHub and before I knew it, I had her repo cloned. This was insane to me because it took me much longer than that to first get true collaborative use out of GitHub. Furthermore, I was able to organize her code a little bit and give her some basic pointers. She was also using Brackets to code this website which I wasn't familiar with before. I suggested VS Code sometime later and she is now using it regardless of the learning curve it poses.

This was really great use of stream time for me. We did this on July 21st according to these stream logs. We have plenty more to catch up on, on this blog. 

Till Next Time,
Fahaam
