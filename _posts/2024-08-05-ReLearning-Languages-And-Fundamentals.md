Another Side Not So Side Quest has been added: Learn Javascript through [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

These "side quests" are actually fundamental to my understanding of computers and the things I'm working with. I'm currently working on learning C through K N King's C Programming: A Modern Approach. The Javascript side of things is fundamental for web development and understanding. Especially considering my Zenith Web App that I'm working on is a MERN stack app. Which means it's using Javascript in multiple different ways and frameworks within the app. I'm also using textbook resources to learn these things. Reading is one of the ways I learn best and stay focused. There is something about learning from textbooks, especially classic ones that I really admire. It's also really easy to get lost in different resources being in the abundance age we live in.

I'm going to make a section dedicated to tracking my progress within these books which you might see up soon. I'm making sure to do the exercises within the books. The whole 9.

Have A Great Day,
Fahaam
