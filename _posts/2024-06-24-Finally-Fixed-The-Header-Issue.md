# Finally Fixed The Blog Header Issue

The blog itself took long enough. This issue was a whole different thing in and of itself. But fixing it allowed me to learn- no it shouldn't have taken this long.

Happy it's done though, and I did learned about deployment through github actions.

Onto the real projects.
