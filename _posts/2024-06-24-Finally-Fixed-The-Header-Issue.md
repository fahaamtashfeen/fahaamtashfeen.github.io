title: Finally Fixed The Blog Header Issue

There was a "skip to..." header on both the main page and each post page. No matter which HTML or CSS I edited, the issue persisted. Previously I had fixed such an issue by corrected something within the CSS files. This time of course, it didn't work. A few days later I figured it out "within seconds", if you count it as that.

The blog itself took long enough. This issue was a whole different thing in and of itself...

Happy it's done though, and I did learn about deployment through github actions.

Onto the real projects.
