I sent my blog to a friend of mine and she pointed out some typos I had. If this was a love language, it would be one of mine.

I point out typos on every single one of my friends posts (if it's of importance, especially to them). A lot of people don't appreciate it and don't see the importance in it, and I respect that.

But as for me, even outside of typos, ALWAYS POINT OUT MY MISTAKES!

Thanks, luv u.
