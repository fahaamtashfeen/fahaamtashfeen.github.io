title: We Have Our Products Displayed!

For the Zenith Gallery website, there is a front-end and back-end. We finally connected them together. Meaning the 'users' will be able to see the products displayed (which reside in the back-end) on the front-end (user view). 

I'm focusing on the balance between technical content and jargon for my blog. Some of my friends have stated that it's cool but they have 'no idea what any of this means'. That's good feedback.

Do I want to make the content more readable for everyone? Or stick to a very niche audience and word choice?

I think right now it's simply a matter of better communication in my content in general. And through that I will find the answer.

Anyways, this products display thing was a huge obstacle because the issues were related to user authentication (the user would need to be authorized in order to view the products which we do not want), and possibly git version control (the authentication was removed but then not pulled later).

I've also been working on some of the design elements of the website. I'm going to need to keep this to a bare minimum in order to get the MVP out (check out [Principles](https://fahaam.tech/misc/2024/06/19/Principles.html)).

Soon,
Fahaam
