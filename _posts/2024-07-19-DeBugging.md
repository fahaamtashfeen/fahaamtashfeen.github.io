The story of my life lately has been debugging. This past week I've been a little sick and the past two days are when it affected my energy. I decided to take it easier yesterday.

Looking for something to destress with as well, I had already downloaded some video games. I used to play more but haven't been as much lately. And I've been loving exploring different art forms and how they portray stories. I had the idea of streaming some coding and gaming as well. Switching back and forth, not putting pressure on productivity directly.

Sure enough, I spent the entire day debugging problems that I never have while streaming. To add to the irony, my friend had come over the previous day and was amazed at how much of "a beast" my laptop still is (it's getting older). And I ended up having a glitchy screen from the HDMI port on the graphics card which was working completely fine when my friend had made that comment.

I fixed that by looking up a solution with 'reddit' attached to the end of the google query. I proceeded to download graphics drivers, a utility to uninstall graphics drivers, and then booted into safe mode to use both.

This did fix the issue with the HDMI (having a dual monitor is amazing in general but even more amazing for streaming). Then it was time to fix OBS. The game was lagging only on the OBS screen and for the stream but it was fine on my computer. I could tell it was more of an OBS issue than a graphics card one.

And even on that, the games weren't even showing up at all. That was the main thing I had to fix. So ultimately the lag remained, and hours later I decided to rock with that anyway.

It was nighttime when we finally streamed, and you know what? I added features to the Zenith Web App that I needed, and I also got to focus on The Witcher 3 for a while which was refreshing and nice.

Till next time,
Fahaam
